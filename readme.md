3d cad scetcher

	- draw lines and arc's on a 3d plane.
	- draw lines and arc's in free 3d space.
	
This is a program in development. It can give you insights how to use a 3d environment to sketch 
lines, arc's and circles.

Shapes can be modified by selecting, dragging.

It has a slightly modified dxfrw lib, where it can read and write 3d arc's in dxf format.
